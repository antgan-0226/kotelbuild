This project provides an automatic solution for Golang applications that want to
leverage OpenTelemetry to enable effective observability. No code changes are
required in the target application, the instrumentation is done at compile
time. Simply replacing `go build` with `otelbuild` to get started :rocket:

# Installation

### Install via Bash
For **Linux and MacOS** users, install the tool by running the following command
```bash
$ sudo curl -fsSL https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alibaba/opentelemetry-go-auto-instrumentation@main/install.sh | sudo bash
```
It will be installed in `/usr/local/bin/otelbuild` by default.

### Precompiled Binary

Please download the latest precompiled release version from
the [Release](https://github.com/antgan-0226/opentelemetry-go-auto-instrumentation/releases)
page.

### Build From Source

Checkout the source code and build the tool by running the following command:

```bash
$ make build
```

# Getting Started

Replace `go build` with the following command to build your project:

```bash
# go build
$ ./otelbuild
```

The arguments for `go build` should be placed after the `--` delimiter:

```bash
# go build -gcflags="-m" cmd/app
$ ./otelbuild -- -gcflags="-m" cmd/app
```

The arguments for the tool itself should be placed before the `--` delimiter:

```bash
$ ./otelbuild -help                             # print help doc
$ ./otelbuild -debug                            # enable debug mode
$ ./otelbuild -verbose -- -gcflags="-m" cmd/app # print verbose log
$ ./otelbuild -rule=custom.json                 # use custom rule
```

You can also explore [**these examples**](./example/) to get hands-on experience.

Also there are several [**documents**](./docs) that you may find useful for either understanding the project or contributing to it.

> [!NOTE]
> If you find any compilation failures while `go build` works, it's likely a bug.
> Please feel free to file a bug
> at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/antgan-0226/opentelemetry-go-auto-instrumentation/issues)
> to help us enhance this project.
